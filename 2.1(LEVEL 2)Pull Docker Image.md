Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:


### a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:local.

To pull the `busybox:musl` image on App Server 1 in Stratos Data Center (DC) and re-tag it as `busybox:local`, you can use the following commands. This assumes that you have Docker installed on App Server 1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Connect to App Server 1:
   
   You can use SSH or any other method to access App Server 1.

2. Pull the `busybox:musl` image:

   Run the following command to pull the `busybox:musl` image from Docker Hub:

   ```
   docker pull busybox:musl
   ```

   This will download the `busybox:musl` image to your server.

3. Re-tag the image as `busybox:local`:

   After pulling the `busybox:musl` image, you can re-tag it with the desired name:

   ```
   docker tag busybox:musl busybox:local
   ```

   This will create a new tag for the image with the name `busybox:local`.

Now you have successfully pulled the `busybox:musl` image and re-tagged it as `busybox:local` on App Server 1 in Stratos Data Center. You can use the `busybox:local` tag to reference the image locally.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
