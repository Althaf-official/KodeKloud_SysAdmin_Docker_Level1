One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name blog:xfusion. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.


### a. On App Server 1 save the image blog:xfusion in an archive.


### b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.


### c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1

----

Certainly! Below are the steps you can follow to achieve the tasks you described:

### On App Server 1:

a. Save the Docker image "blog:xfusion" into an archive.

```bash
# Save the Docker image to a tar archive
docker save -o blog_xfusion.tar blog:xfusion
```

### Transfer the image archive to App Server 3:

You can use various methods to transfer the image archive to App Server 3, such as SCP (Secure Copy) or any other file transfer method you prefer. Here, we'll use SCP as an example:

```bash
# Replace 'user' and 'app_server_3_ip' with your actual SSH username and App Server 3 IP address
scp blog_xfusion.tar user@app_server_3_ip:/path/to/destination
```

### On App Server 3:

c. Load the Docker image archive with the same name and tag as used on App Server 1.

```bash
# Load the Docker image from the tar archive
docker load -i /path/to/destination/blog_xfusion.tar
```

Make sure Docker is running on both App Server 1 and App Server 3. If Docker is not running, start the Docker service:

```bash
# Start Docker service
sudo service docker start
```

Now, the "blog:xfusion" Docker image should be loaded on App Server 3 and ready for testing. Make sure to replace placeholders such as 'user', 'app_server_3_ip', and '/path/to/destination' with your actual values.

Note: Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform Docker-related actions and file transfers. Additionally, consider securing the file transfer method with proper authentication and encryption based on your organization's security policies.
