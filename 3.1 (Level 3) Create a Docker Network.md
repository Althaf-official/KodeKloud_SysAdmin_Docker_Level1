The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:


a. Create a docker network named as blog on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.


b. Configure it to use bridge drivers.


c. Set it to use subnet 192.168.30.0/24 and iprange 192.168.30.3/24.

To achieve the tasks mentioned, you would typically use the Docker command-line interface (CLI) on App Server 3 in the Stratos DC. Here are the steps to create a Docker network named "blog" with the specified configurations:

a. Create a Docker network named "blog" on App Server 3:

```bash
docker network create blog
```

b. Configure it to use bridge drivers:

Bridge drivers are the default network drivers for Docker, so no additional configuration is needed for this step.

c. Set it to use subnet 192.168.30.0/24 and iprange 192.168.30.3/24:

```bash
docker network create --subnet=192.168.30.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.30.3/24 blog
```

This command creates a Docker network named "blog" with the specified subnet (192.168.30.0/24) and IP range (192.168.30.3/24).

After executing these commands, you will have a Docker network named "blog" on App Server 3 in the Stratos DC, configured with the bridge driver, subnet 192.168.30.0/24, and IP range 192.168.30.3/24. You can verify the network by running:

```bash
docker network inspect blog
```

This command will display detailed information about the "blog" network, including its configuration.

-------------

If you're encountering an error indicating that the network with the name "blog" already exists, you can either choose a different name for the network or remove the existing network with the same name and then recreate it. Here are the steps:

1. **Choose a Different Name:**

   If you want to create a new network with a different name, you can run the following command with a unique name, for example, "blog2":

   ```bash
   docker network create --subnet=192.168.30.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.30.3/24 blog2
   ```

2. **Remove Existing Network and Recreate:**

   If you want to use the same name "blog" and replace the existing network, you can remove the existing network first and then recreate it:

   ```bash
   # Remove the existing network named "blog"
   docker network rm blog

   # Recreate the network with the same name and desired configuration
   docker network create --subnet=192.168.30.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.30.3/24 blog
   ```

   After running these commands, you should have the "blog" network recreated with the specified subnet and IP range.

Choose the option that best fits your requirements, and it should resolve the issue.
