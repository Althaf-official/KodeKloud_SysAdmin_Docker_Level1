One of the Nautilus project developers need access to run docker commands on App Server 2. This user is already created on the server. Accomplish this task as per details given below:



### User siva is not able to run docker commands on App Server 2 in Stratos DC, make the required changes so that this user can run docker commands without sudo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To allow a user, in this case "siva," to run Docker commands without using sudo, you can add the user to the "docker" group. This group is created when you install Docker and has the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon. Here's how you can do it:

1. SSH into App Server 2:
   ```
   ssh username@app-server-2
   ```

2. Check if the "docker" group exists:
   ```
   cat /etc/group | grep docker
   ```

   You should see a line similar to this:
   ```
   docker:x:xxx:
   ```

==============================
$cat /etc/group | grep docker
docker:x:995:steve


It appears that the "docker" group already exists, and the user "steve" is a member of the "docker" group. If you want to allow the user "siva" to run Docker commands without sudo, you can simply add "siva" to the "docker" group, as previously mentioned.

To add "siva" to the "docker" group, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker siva
```

After running this command, "siva" should be able to run Docker commands without using sudo after logging out and logging back in or using the `newgrp` command.

=========================

3. If the "docker" group doesn't exist, create it:
   ```
   sudo groupadd docker
   ```

4. Add the user "siva" to the "docker" group:
   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker siva
   ```

5. Check if the user "siva" is now part of the "docker" group:
   ```
   groups siva
   ```

   You should see "siva" listed along with "docker" in the output.

6. To apply the changes, it's a good practice to log out and log back in, or you can use the `newgrp` command to activate the group without logging out:
   ```
   newgrp docker
   ```

7. Test whether "siva" can run Docker commands without sudo:
   ```
   docker --version
   ```

   If you see the Docker version without any permission errors, it means "siva" can now run Docker commands without using sudo.

Please be cautious when granting Docker access to users without sudo, as they will have significant control over the system, including the ability to start and stop containers. Make sure you trust the user with this level of access.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
