The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:


### a. Pull nginx:alpine docker image on Application Server 3.


### b. Create a container named news using the image you pulled.


### c. Map host port 8082 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.
