###  There is a static website running within a container named nautilus, this container is running on App Server 1. Suddenly, we started facing some issues with the static website on App Server 1. Look into the issue to fix the same, you can find more details below:



Container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

The website should run on host port 8080 on App Server 1 i.e command curl http://localhost:8080/ should work on App Server 1.


```ruby
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh tony@stapp01

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

To create a Docker container using the provided requirements where the container's volume `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` is mapped with the host's volume `/var/www/html`, and the website should run on host port 8080, you can use the following `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d --name my_website_container -p 8080:80 -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs nginx:alpine
```

Here's an explanation of the command:

- `docker run`: This command is used to create and start a new Docker container.

- `-d`: It runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.

- `--name my_website_container`: Assigns a name to the container, in this case, "my_website_container."

- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container. This is how you expose the website on the host's port 8080.

- `-v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`: This option creates a volume mapping, where the host's directory `/var/www/html` is mapped to the container's directory `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`. This ensures that the website content on the host is synchronized with the container.

- `nginx:alpine`: Specifies the Docker image to use, in this case, the "nginx" image based on Alpine Linux. This image is commonly used for serving web content.

After running this command, the website should be accessible on App Server 1 at `http://localhost:8080/` as specified in the requirements.

[root@stapp01 ~]# curl http://localhost:8080/
