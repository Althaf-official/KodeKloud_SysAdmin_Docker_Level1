One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:


# a. Create an image beta:datacenter on Application Server 2 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

To create a Docker image named "beta:datacenter" on Application Server 2 from a running container "ubuntu_latest" on the same server, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the "ubuntu_latest" container is running on Application Server 2.

2. Open a terminal on Application Server 2.

3. Use the `docker commit` command to create a new image from the running container. Replace `container_id` with the actual ID of the "ubuntu_latest" container:

   ```bash
   sudo docker commit container_id beta:datacenter
   ```

   This command creates a new Docker image tagged as "beta:datacenter" based on the current state of the "ubuntu_latest" container.

4. To verify that the image has been created, you can use the `docker images` command:

   ```bash
   sudo docker images
   ```

   You should see "beta:datacenter" listed in the images.

Now, you have created an image named "beta:datacenter" on Application Server 2 from the "ubuntu_latest" container running on the same server. You can use this image to create new containers or share it with other Docker hosts if needed.
