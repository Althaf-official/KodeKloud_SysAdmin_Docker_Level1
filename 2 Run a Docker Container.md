### Nautilus DevOps team is testing some applications deployment on some of the application servers. They need to deploy a nginx container on Application Server 3. Please complete the task as per details given below:


On Application Server 3 create a container named nginx_3 using image nginx with alpine tag and make sure container is in running state.

```ruby
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@172.16.238.12

```
The command `docker run -d --name nginx_3 -p 80:80 nginx:alpine` is used to create and run a Docker container from the `nginx:alpine` image with specific configuration options. Let's break down the command:

1. **`docker run`**: This part of the command tells Docker to run a new container.

2. **`-d`**: The `-d` flag stands for "detached." It runs the container in the background, which means it won't take over your current terminal session, and you can continue to use the terminal for other commands.

3. **`--name nginx_3`**: This option specifies the name of the container. In this case, the container will be named "nginx_3."

4. **`-p 80:80`**: The `-p` flag is used to map ports between the host and the container. In this case, it's mapping port 80 from the host to port 80 in the container. This means that any traffic directed to port 80 on the host machine will be forwarded to port 80 in the running container.

5. **`nginx:alpine`**: This is the image you want to use for creating the container. It specifies the image name (`nginx`) and the tag (`alpine`). The `alpine` tag indicates the lightweight Alpine Linux-based version of the Nginx image.

So, in summary, the command `docker run -d --name nginx_3 -p 80:80 nginx:alpine` creates a detached Docker container named "nginx_3" from the "nginx:alpine" image and maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. This allows you to run Nginx in a containerized environment with the specified configuration.


```ruby
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker ps
